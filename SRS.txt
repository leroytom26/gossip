### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines the software requirements for the "Gossip with Brother Elkana" platform. The system will support Twitter Spaces-based discussions, participant rewards, and partnerships with businesses to foster meaningful conversations around relationships, mental wellness, family, and faith-centered values.

#### 1.2 Scope
"Gossip with Brother Elkana" is a platform designed to:
- Host and manage Twitter Spaces sessions.

- Provide an admin dashboard for session and partnership management.

The system backend will use Python (FastAPI) deployed on Render.com, and the frontend will use Next.js deployed on Vercel. Supabase will manage the database.

#### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **Twitter Spaces**: Audio-based discussion feature on Twitter.
- **Supabase**: A backend-as-a-service platform built on PostgreSQL.
- **MVP**: Minimum Viable Product.
- **OAuth 2.0**: Authentication protocol for secure user login.
